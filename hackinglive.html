<h1>Hacking Live!</h1>

<p>
We're excited to present a DJ line-up, starting at 8pm, Saturday October 17. Show your appreciation, drop-in and contribute a 10 minute + visual of your hacker best: dancing, working a project, gaming, or showcasing a screen hack.
</p>

<p>No commentary or audio required, the DJs have that covered. Just hop onto the Google Meet (to be linked here) and casually do something shared on screen or or on camera. We'll stream these visuals + DJ audio YouTube as a secondary feed. (DJs primary). Some ideas:
</p>
