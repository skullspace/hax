  So you can access it again without having to go through the donation portal. There isn't anything like a ticket or a welcome email to get you back here.
</p>

<p>
  The festival starts Friday October 16 at 7:30pm Winnipeg time. The full schedule is at the bottom of this page.
</p>

<p>Elements of the festival will be embedded below in different sections, depending on what is currently live. Outside festival hours the only live element is the #SkullSpace chanel on the <a href="https://freenode.net/" target="_blank">freenode</a> IRC network. There may be anyone active in the channel at a given time, but you can leave messages for the festival organizer, "markjenkinsznc".
