</p>

<p>Submit your pitch for presentation, performance or play session that would be of interest to a hackerspace community by email to Mark Jenkins <a href="mailto:mark@parit.ca">mark@parit.ca</a>.
</p>

<p>Though the goal is to have most presentations and performances given live, we will make exceptions for pre-recorded sessions if they consist of exceptional material being publicly showcased for the first time or if it features a Manitoba resident from a community under represented in hacker spaces.
