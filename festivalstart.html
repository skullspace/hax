<p>Elements of the festival will be embedded below in different sections, depending on what is currently live. Outside festival hours the only live element is the #SkullSpace chanel on the <a href="https://freenode.net/" target="_blank">freenode</a> IRC network. There may be anyone active in the channel at a given time, but you can leave messages for the festival organizer, "markjenkinsznc".
