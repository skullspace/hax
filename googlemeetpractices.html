<h3>Arrive 10 minutes prior</h3>

<p>
To minimize interruptions, we ask that you only join the video conference in the 10 minute period prior to a session start. See the schedule for start times. If you're late, please rely on the YouTube stream or direct video stream to see the proceedings and use the #SkullSpace Freenode chat for interaction.
</p>

<p>
Generally we will be declining entry to our Google Meet video conference after a presentation starts. We may make some exceptions for trusted community members. If we afford you the privilege of late entry, enter with your microphone muted and wait for the presenter to welcome audience participation before speaking.
</p>

<h3>Audio best-practices</h3>

<p>As hosts, we may need to mute-microphones en-mass to manage the room and audio quality.
</p>

<p>Best practices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>we recommend self-muting your own microphone when you're not addressing the presenter or room</li>
    <li>the importance of self-muting grows if you are listening to our video conference on speakers to prevent echo
    </li>
    <li>it's best to listen to the video conference on headphones instead of speakers if you anticipate unmuting to interact with presenters and other participants a lot during a particular session
    </li>

  </ul>

<h3>Our Google Meet is recorded!</h3>

<p>Google Meet will warn you that we are recording this video conference. You have the option to keep your camera and microphone off at all times and can use the Google Meet chat to interact.
</p>

<p>We hope the Google Meet recording feature also serves as a reminder that we are streaming the video conference to YouTube and a direct stream. We are archiving the YouTube stream.
</p>

<p>The best way to guard your privacy is to not rely on the Google Meet at all and use our YouTube or direct stream to view the proceedings and #SkullSpace channel on the freenode IRC network for interaction</p>

<h3>Google account not required, but will be used if already logged in</h3>

<p>If you are logged into other Google services when you join Google Meet video conference, your name and profile icon from your Google will be visible to other participants. To avoid this, use a private/incognito browser session to not carry over your usual Google login. (In other words, our Google Meet link does not require a logged in Google account, but will use it if you're already logged in)
